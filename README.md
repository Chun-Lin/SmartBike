# SmartBike

This is an IoT project, and the files are frontend codes.

In this project, we used raspberry pi with GPS and camera modules to take video clips and then uploaded to the database. 
So we had location information about the clips in the database, then we used the google map library to grab the video clips in the zone we drew.
